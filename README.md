# Bubble-Sort-Simulator
Bubble Sort Simulator is a Computer Graphics Program written in C++ and uses OpenGL. It simulates an aesthetic graphical visualization of the Bubble Sort algorithm on a User entered array of numbers to better ease understanding. It shows how adjacent numbers are compared and swapped. It also keeps a count of the number of passes, swaps and comparisons carried out. The main animation window of the Program uses GLFW and Modern OpenGL. The Menu Window on the other hand uses GLUT and legacy OpenGL functions.
